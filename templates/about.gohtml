    <h1>About</h1>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This project is an assignment done for my studies in my first year of computer science. It is a website based on an API named MangaDex. It permits to search, consult and read mangas.</p>
    <p>All resources are available for all users (search and advanced search, manga page and chapter page). Only the favorites feature are for registered users only.</p>
    <p>The mangas available in the website are all in english (title, description, scans) and SFW (contentRating[]=safe).</p>

    <h2>Presentation</h2>

    <p>Since a few years ago, I discovered the world of mangas, manwas and manhuas (japanese, corean and chinese respectively). I always enjoyed, since childhood, reading comics, like Asterix and when I began reading mangas, I was impressed at the quality of some of the drawings and the stories. The difference in culture also interested me quite a bit, because their perspective on a lot of topics was very different from what I was used to in my culture and vision of the world. That point make me reflect in depth about a lot of cultural, psychological and philosophical topics.</p>
    <p>That's why I chose, for this assignment, to do a website to browse and read mangas. Moreover, there were times when I really disliked the design of the website on which I was reading mangas, so it added an extra motivation to work hard on the frontend development. I am planning to keep working on this project to improve and add features. I will list some features I plan to add in the future, depending on my availability and workload.</p>
    <p>The website is quite straightforward in its organization. Here is the list of the actual pages available:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The principal page, in which there are some most popular mangas and the latest uploaded on MangaDex displayed</li>
        <li>The category page, to display all mangas of a specific category</li>
        <li>The categories page, to display the list of all available categories, sorted by type</li>
        <li>The search page, to perform advanced researches and see the corresponding results</li>
        <li>The manga page, to display all information about a single manga, with a list of chapters, with a pagination feature to browse through the chapters</li>
        <li>The chapter page, to display the scans of a specific chapter</li>
        <li>The login page</li>
        <li>The register page, to create an account</li>
        <li>The mail confirmed page, when your mail is confirmed and your account enabled</li>
        <li>The forgot password page, when you don't remember your password (it happens to everyone, really)</li>
        <li>The update credentials page, when you clicked on the link sent by mail to set a new password</li>
        <li>The home page, to display the user's favorites mangas</li>
        <li>The profile page, to update the user's information(avatar and password for the moment)</li>
        <li>The error page (hope you don't need to see it)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Work in progress</h2>

    <p>As I said before, I plan to keep working on this project to improve and add features. Here is a list of features I want to add in the future:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a mail and username field in the profile page</li>
        <li>Add a 'read last read chapter' in any favorite manga displayed on the home page</li>
        <li>Add an administration area</li>
        <li>Improve the search feature (keep the advanced search form with the values set by the user in its research)</li>
        <li>Link the user's profile to Gravatar API</li>
        <li>Make the principal page's banner random, and maybe animate it with a carousel</li>
        <li>Make a carousel for the popular and latest uploaded mangas in the principal page</li>
        <li>Make the website fully responsive with a phone and tablet version</li>
        <li>Shift the server from HTTP to HTTPS</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My thoughts about this projet</h2>

    <p>I really enjoyed developping this website: it made me discover a lot of things, especially the cookies (to handle the user's connection) and the middlewares. I am grateful to benefit from the timely update of Golang to version 1.22 to enhance routing: it made the process much easier than it would be otherwise. I also discovered Figma to make a graphic model before beginning to code the frontend, and I had a definite design before attempting to code (it made me gain time on the trial and error process normally present in frontend development).</p>

    <p>To set this project on its initial stage, I spent my time in the following manner:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A week and a half on Figma to do the frontend model</li>
        <li>A month learning how to use cookies and middlewares</li>
        <li>Three weeks coding the website (Backend: API handling, cache handling, routing, etc. / Frontend: HTML, SCSS and Javascript)</li>
    </ul>
